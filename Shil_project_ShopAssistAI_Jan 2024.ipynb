Graphics Processor: Look for a laptop with a high-performance dedicated graphics card, such as Nvidia GeForce GTX or RTX series.\\n\\n2. Display Quality: Search for a laptop with a high-resolution display, preferably Full HD (1920x1080) or higher. Look for features like HDR support and excellent color accuracy.\\n\\n3. Portability: Since portability is not a priority, you can focus on laptops with larger form factors and higher weight.\\n\\n4. Multitasking: Consider a laptop with a minimum of 16GB RAM to ensure smooth multitasking and handling multiple applications simultaneously.\\n\\n5. Processing Speed: Look for laptops with high-performance processors like Intel Core i7 or higher, or AMD Ryzen 7 or higher.\\n\\n6. Budget: Your budget of 25000 INR may limit the options to entry-level or older models. Consider looking for refurbished or discounted laptops to maximize the features within your budget.\\n\\nIt is important to note that finding a laptop with these specifications within your budget may be challenging. You may need to compromise on certain features or consider alternative options like refurbished laptops or upgrading individual components later on. Additionally, availability and pricing may vary depending on your location and current market conditions. It is recommended to thoroughly research and compare different laptop models before making a purchase.\"\n",
